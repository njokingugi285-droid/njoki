#The multi-agent approach provided significant advantages over a hypothetical single-agent
system. By separating responsibilities across specialized agents, the system achieved
greater clarity, safety, and interpretability. Each agent focused on a narrow task, which
reduced cognitive overload and minimized hallucination risks in a sensitive healthcare
domain.

Compared to a single agent attempting intake, analysis, safety checks, and recommendations
simultaneously, the multi-agent design allowed explicit safety validation and structured
decision points. The Risk & Safety Checker agent was particularly valuable, as it could
override the flow when urgent symptoms were detected.

Overall, the multi-agent architecture improved modularity, debuggability, and trustworthiness.
While it introduces coordination overhead, the benefits outweigh the costs in high-risk
applications such as healthcare advisory systems.
